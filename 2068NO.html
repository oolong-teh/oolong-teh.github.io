			They sit, huddled around an old flashlight, in a ramshackle cabin a day’s journey away from the Canadian border. There were around 40 of them, covered in emergency blankets and huffing into their hands to stay warm. Fearful, anxious, and oddly hopeful, they wait for one of the caravan operators to break the silence with plans about the crossing the border from what’s left of the  United States to Canada.

			The caravan operators, three of them, deliberate quietly in a table in a corner. Aware that the only thing shielding them from the mercurial climate is a single layer of rotting wood, they whisper quickly. Moving the caravan too quickly might tire out the older members. Moving too slowly and they might just get caught. Which town along the border should they stop at? Who could they trust? Which part of the wall should they penetrate? Anxious eyes track each breath, each flick of a finger. Once the three operators come to a decision, one of them heads for the door and stands sentry. They creak the door open ever so slightly. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The sentry remember what their grandparents used to tell them about what this area used to be. Fifty years ago, it was called New England. During falls of past, the trees would come afire with leaves of red, orange, and yellow. Though the weather would fluctuate a few degrees each day, it would never snow aggressively and then suddenly heat up fifty degrees within a span of a few hours. The area was filled with rolling hills, unlike the present terrain, flattened and littered with abandoned factories. Off to the distance, the sentry could make out the faint silhouette of The Wall, a concrete structure that runs along the Canada-US border. They remember their grandparents telling them of the time when that wall wasn't there. There was a different wall, which has now been eaten away by time and warfare.

			The other two caravan operators stand in front of the cabin. The shorter one passes around survival packs: small bags filled with food, water, survival guides, and blankets. It’s not their first trip across the border and it certainly won’t be their last. They remember when they lead the walk to Canada. That was eight years ago, when laws weren’t as strict. When people weren’t so desperate to leave the United States. Eight years ago, there were more jobs, there was more land. Now, the American administration is plagued with corruption and is neck-deep in debt to Canada and China. Twenty years ago, Canada was accepting American migrants left and right. Most of these immigrants did the “dirty jobs”: cleaning out waste from power plants, extracting oil from the ground, and keeping the furnace going during these cold bursts. Over time, more and more immigrants moved away from these low-paying jobs. They started becoming managers and office workers. And Canadians got angry. So, the Canadian government spent ten years building The Wall, to keep Canadians happy and Americans out. Now, the Wall looms in the distance, as if challenging, daring them to penetrate it. But, they were able to do it before and they’re going to do it again.

			Once everyone received their packets, the taller of the two caravan operators steps forward and clears their throat. Anxious eyes are all on them. They think about the stories they’ve heard from older family members about crossing the US-Mexico border fifty years before. They remember their family members telling them about how America was full of opportunity. <b>America was not perfect, but it was a gamble that they were willing to take. It was worth crossing the border, of penetrating the wall.</b>
